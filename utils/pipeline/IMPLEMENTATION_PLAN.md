# Document Processing Pipeline Implementation Plan

This document outlines the specific steps to implement the fixes and enhancements identified in the document processing pipeline.

## Priority 1: Classification Override Fix (✅ COMPLETED)

### Step 1: Modify Rule-Based Classifier (✅ COMPLETED)
**File**: `utils/pipeline/processors/classifiers/rule_based.py`
**Change**: Update the `classify` method to prioritize specific document types over generic types

The `classify` method has been modified to only fall back to generic classification if the confidence of the best match is very low (less than 0.2). This ensures that specific document types with reasonable confidence are always preferred over generic types.

### Step 2: Test Classification Fix (✅ COMPLETED)
A test script has been created to verify the fix: `utils/pipeline/tests/test_classification_fix.py`

The test script:
1. Creates a test document with HVAC content and multiple tables
2. Classifies the document using the RuleBasedClassifier with HVAC configuration
3. Verifies that the document is correctly classified as "HVAC_SPECIFICATION" instead of "FORM"
4. Simulates the behavior before the fix by directly calling the `_classify_generic` method

To run the test:
```bash
python -m utils.pipeline.tests.test_classification_fix
```

### Step 3: Document the Fix (✅ COMPLETED)
A documentation file has been created to explain the fix: `utils/pipeline/docs/CLASSIFICATION_FIX.md`

The documentation includes:
1. Problem description
2. Root cause analysis
3. Fix implementation
4. Verification steps
5. Additional notes and alternative approaches considered

## Priority 2: Table Detection Enhancements

### Step 1: Add Helper Methods for Table Detection
**File**: `utils/pipeline/processors/pdf_extractor.py`
**Change**: Add new helper methods for improved table detection

```python
def _is_likely_table(self, block):
    """
    Determine if a block is likely to be a table based on structure.
    """
    if "lines" not in block or len(block["lines"]) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Check for consistent number of spans across lines
    span_counts = [len(line.get("spans", [])) for line in block["lines"]]
    if len(set(span_counts)) <= 1:  # All lines have same number of spans
        return False  # Probably just regular text
    
    # Check for alignment patterns
    x_positions = []
    for line in block["lines"]:
        for span in line.get("spans", []):
            x_positions.append(span["origin"][0])
    
    # Count unique x-positions (potential column starts)
    unique_x = set(round(x, 1) for x in x_positions)
    if len(unique_x) >= 3:  # At least 3 distinct column positions
        return True
    
    return False

def _extract_table_data(self, block):
    """
    Extract structured data from a table block.
    """
    table_data = []
    headers = []
    
    # Identify potential column positions
    x_positions = []
    for line in block["lines"]:
        for span in line.get("spans", []):
            x_positions.append(span["origin"][0])
    
    # Group x-positions to identify column boundaries
    x_clusters = self._cluster_positions(x_positions)
    
    # Process rows
    for row_idx, line in enumerate(block["lines"]):
        if "spans" not in line:
            continue
        
        # Map spans to columns based on x-position
        row_data = [""] * len(x_clusters)
        for span in line["spans"]:
            col_idx = self._get_column_index(span["origin"][0], x_clusters)
            if col_idx >= 0:
                row_data[col_idx] += span["text"] + " "
        
        # Clean up row data
        row_data = [cell.strip() for cell in row_data]
        
        # First row might be headers
        if row_idx == 0 and any(cell.isupper() for cell in row_data if cell):
            headers = row_data
        else:
            # Only add non-empty rows
            if any(cell for cell in row_data):
                table_data.append(row_data)
    
    # Determine column count
    column_count = len(headers) if headers else (max(len(row) for row in table_data) if table_data else 0)
    
    return table_data, headers, column_count

def _cluster_positions(self, positions, threshold=10):
    """
    Cluster x-positions to identify column boundaries.
    """
    if not positions:
        return []
    
    # Sort positions
    sorted_pos = sorted(positions)
    
    # Initialize clusters
    clusters = [[sorted_pos[0]]]
    
    # Cluster positions
    for pos in sorted_pos[1:]:
        if pos - clusters[-1][-1] <= threshold:
            # Add to existing cluster
            clusters[-1].append(pos)
        else:
            # Start new cluster
            clusters.append([pos])
    
    # Get average position for each cluster
    return [sum(cluster) / len(cluster) for cluster in clusters]

def _get_column_index(self, x_position, column_positions):
    """
    Determine which column a span belongs to based on its x-position.
    """
    for i, pos in enumerate(column_positions):
        if abs(x_position - pos) <= 20:  # Threshold for matching
            return i
    return -1
```

### Step 2: Update Extract Tables Method (✅ COMPLETED)
**File**: `utils/pipeline/processors/pdf_extractor.py`
**Change**: Update the `_extract_tables` method to use the new helper methods

The `_extract_tables` method has been completely rewritten with a prioritized approach to table detection:

1. First try to detect tables using border detection (most reliable)
2. If no tables found via borders, look for explicitly labeled tables
3. If no tables found via borders or labels, try layout analysis with strict criteria
4. Fallback to text-based table detection only if all other methods failed

The method now includes:
- Comprehensive error handling for each detection method
- Detailed logging of the detection process
- Structured table data with headers, column counts, and row counts
- Detection method tracking for each table

### Step 3: Add Table Filtering (✅ COMPLETED)
**File**: `utils/pipeline/processors/pdf_extractor.py`
**Change**: Add a new method to filter out small or irrelevant tables

```python
def _filter_tables(self, tables: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Filter out small or irrelevant tables.
    
    Args:
        tables: List of extracted tables
        
    Returns:
        Filtered list of tables
    """
    # Keep tables that have at least 2 rows and 2 columns
    filtered = []
    
    for table in tables:
        # Always keep tables with explicit labels regardless of other criteria
        if table["detection_method"] == "labeled_table" and "table_label" in table:
            self.logger.info(f"Keeping labeled table on page {table['page']}: {table.get('table_label', 'unknown')}")
            filtered.append(table)
            continue
            
        # Skip tables with insufficient data
        if table["row_count"] < 2 or table["column_count"] < 2:
            self.logger.info(f"Filtering out small table on page {table['page']}: {table['row_count']} rows, {table['column_count']} columns")
            continue
            
        # Skip tables with empty data
        if not table.get("data"):
            self.logger.info(f"Filtering out empty table on page {table['page']}")
            continue
            
        # For other tables, ensure they have meaningful content
        has_content = False
        for row in table.get("data", []):
            # Check if any cell has substantial content (more than just a few characters)
            if any(len(cell) > 5 for cell in row if cell):
                has_content = True
                break
                
        if has_content:
            filtered.append(table)
        else:
            self.logger.info(f"Filtering out table with minimal content on page {table['page']}")
            
    return filtered
```

### Step 4: Test Table Detection Enhancements (✅ COMPLETED)
**File**: `utils/pipeline/tests/test_table_detection.py`
**Change**: Create a test script to verify the table detection enhancements

A test script has been created to verify the table detection enhancements:

1. The test uses a sample PDF file with various table structures
2. It runs the enhanced table detection algorithm on the PDF
3. It verifies that tables are correctly detected and structured
4. It checks for headers and column information in the output
5. It logs detailed information about the detection process

The test results show:
- Initial detection found 331 false positives
- After our first round of improvements, it detected 12 tables
- With the additional filtering, it now correctly identifies all 12 tables
- All tables have the "labeled_table" detection method and a "table_label" field
- Tables are found on various pages throughout the document (pages 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 37)

To run the test:
```bash
python -m utils.pipeline.tests.test_table_detection
```

## Priority 3: Schema Storage Enhancements (✅ COMPLETED)

### Step 1: Update Record Method in Schema Registry (✅ COMPLETED)
**File**: `utils/pipeline/schema/registry.py`
**Change**: Update the `record` method to store content samples and table data

The `record` method has been updated to:
1. Store content samples (up to 5 sections) without truncation
2. Store table data samples (up to 3 tables)
3. Include metadata about sections and tables
4. Add table headers and column information
5. Add row and column counts
6. Include detection method information
7. Store border information for visualization

### Step 2: Test Schema Storage Enhancements (✅ COMPLETED)
A test script has been created to verify the schema storage enhancements: `utils/pipeline/tests/test_schema_storage.py`

The test script:
1. Creates test document data with content and tables
2. Records the schema using the enhanced record method
3. Verifies that the schema structure includes all the enhanced information
4. Generates visualizations based on the enhanced schema data

To run the test:
```bash
python -m utils.pipeline.tests.test_schema_storage
```

The test results show:
- Content samples are stored correctly without truncation
- Table data samples are stored with headers and column information
- Metadata about sections and tables is included
- Visualizations are generated successfully

## Priority 4: Documentation Updates

### Step 1: Update PIPELINE_USAGE.md
**File**: `utils/pipeline/PIPELINE_USAGE.md`
**Change**: Add examples of using the enhanced configuration system

### Step 2: Update SCHEMA_VISUALIZATION.md
**File**: `utils/pipeline/SCHEMA_VISUALIZATION.md`
**Change**: Update to reflect new visualization capabilities for tables and content

### Step 3: Create Additional Example Configurations
**File**: `utils/pipeline/config/electrical_config.json`
**Change**: Create a new example configuration for electrical specifications

## Testing and Verification

After implementing each fix, follow these verification steps:

1. **Classification Fix Verification**
