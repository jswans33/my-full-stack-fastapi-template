The\nA:   Alternate approaches to an active confinement ventilation system are containment and passive confinement.   A containment\napproach differs from a confinement approach in that the goal of containment is 100% containment of radioactive materials. In reality,\neven a containment approach results in some level of leakage but this is managed to an absolute minimum by code compliance which\nrequires periodic penetration leak rate tests and full building leak rate tests (ANS 56.8, Containment System Leakage Testing\nRequirements).\nPassive confinement involves dependence on minimization of paths of leakage of hazardous materials when a ventilation system is not\nrunning.  The DOE Toolbox Code MELCOR provides a tool for analyzing a building leak path factor (LPF).  Very high assurance of\nadequate confinement under passive confinement conditions means a technically defensible analysis of the LPF and comparison of the\nresults with applicable dose limits under normal and accident conditions.
