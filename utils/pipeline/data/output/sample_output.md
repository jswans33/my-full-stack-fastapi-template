# A.

Guidance: At LANL’s altitude, the air pressure and density is lower than at sea level, the
condition for which HVAC equipment is designed/rated.  Therefore, HVAC equipment
operating at LANL produces less than its catalog rating. Correcting for this during
design is required so that procurement of appropriately larger equipment occurs.  Thus,
in the procurement spec that’s developed after the sizing calculations, this larger
equipment should be specified, knowing it will be adequately sized when operating at
LANL altitude.  The spec should either (1) be clear that output ratings are already
adjusted for altitude and should not be further adjusted by the vendor, or (2) leave
correction up to the vendor (e.g., “Achieve XXX Btu/hr at 7500 feet”).  If the correction
has been made and captured in the specification’s data, then the procurement spec
shouldn’t also say something like “equipment provided be sized for LANL altitude,”
since this could result in a doubly-corrected outcome.


# B.

Ideally, only the calculated actual operating parameters (capacity, static pressure,
cooling/heating loads) required at 7500 ft elevation should be shown on the design
drawings and in the technical specifications.  Only a statement such as "ALL
CAPACITIES SHOWN OR INDICATED ARE AT 7500 FT ELEVATION" should be
included in the drawings or specifications.  It should be the responsibility of the
Contractor or the equipment manufacturer to make the needed adjustments to their
equipment to meet the requirements at the 7500 ft elevation.  The equipment
manufacturer should be asked to provide submittal (fan curves, performance data) to
back up their selection.
3.1
Fans


# A.

Correct catalog data before applying it at LANL’s 7,500 foot altitude.  Guidance: Failure
to correct for altitude will result in undersized equipment. An increase in altitude means
a decrease in air density and barometric pressure. Air moving equipment is rated and
cataloged at sea level (standard air density 0.075 pcf at 70 degrees and 29.92 inches Hg
barometric pressure)


# B.

Guidance: Fans are constant volume devices and therefore air density has no effect on
the volume delivered; however, it does affect the motor horsepower, static pressure, and
mass flow rate.
3.2
Fan Selection Procedure at 7,500 Foot Altitude (Guidance)


# A.

Determine the actual volumetric flow rate (acfm) at 7500 feet.


# B.

Using this actual flow rate (acfm) and standard air (sea level) friction data to design the
ductwork, calculate the system static pressure at sea level.


# C.

Select the fan by referring to sea level fan capacity tables and using the actual cfm
required at altitude and the system static pressure calculated at sea level.  The rpm
shown in the tables is the rpm at which the fan must operate and need not be corrected.
LANL Engineering Standards Manual STD-342-100
Chapter 6-Mechanical
Section D30 HVAC, Heating, Cooling, HVAC Distribution, and TAB
Rev. 5, 9/29/14
Page 9 of 40


# D.

Correct the static pressure and brake horsepower (bhp) shown in the fan tables to
altitude conditions by dividing these values by the air density ratio at 7,500 feet (nominal
1.32 at 70 degree F).  This yields the static pressure that the fan will produce at altitude
and the BHP required at altitude.  Refer to Table D30GEN-2 when installation
environment involves non-standard temperatures at 7,500 feet elevation.

# E.

High Temperature: Exercise caution in selecting the motor sizes for operating fans
handling high temperature air.  If a fan system designed to operate with high temperature
air is started when the system is cold, the fan will require more horsepower during start
up; therefore, the motor size should be selected for cold starting.
3.3
Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Equipment, Etc.


# A.

Derate air-cooled equipment (e.g., chillers, coils, condensers, cooling towers, VAVs,
VFDs) for altitude.  Guidance: Consult with manufacturer and the following publications


# for derating data:

1.
Carrier: Engineering Guide for Altitude Effects.
2.
Trane: Effects of Altitude on Air Conditioning Equipment.
3.4
Fume Hood and Local Exhaust Design


# A.

The exhaust airflow from fume hoods and other local exhaust systems such as welding
benches, snorkels, and open surface tanks must be determined carefully.  Capture
velocities and face velocities shall be as recommended in the latest ACGIH, Industrial
Ventilation – A Manual of Recommended Practice for Design.  The cfm/ft² or fpm values
given shall be taken to mean acfm/ft² or fpm at altitude.  When a range of capture
velocities is given, the upper end of the range shall be chosen.

Gas-Fired Equipment


# A.

Determine natural gas consumption (cfh) by dividing the Btu/h input rating at sea level
by the gas heating value of 1000 Btu/ft3. 5


# B.

Derate gas-fired heating units and atmospheric boilers catalog output rating by 30
percent.6


# C.

Specify gas fired units that will be operating at 7500 feet altitude (see Chapter 1, Z1010
Constants, for altitude exceptions) so the manufacturer can factory install the correct gas
orifices.


# D.

For forced-draft boilers, consult with manufacturer for derating criteria.

scaling problems.
1.
Consult the ESM Mechanical POC for specific requirements, such as type of
treatment system, chemicals, etc.  For existing facilities the LANL System
Engineer will be consulted to determine preferred chemicals.


# B.

Provide biocide products that are registered with the EPA, with the registration number
clearly shown on the drum.


# C.

Chemical supplier personnel using biocide products shall have a New Mexico
Department of Agriculture (NMDA) pesticide applicator license.


# D.

Preheat Coils


# A.

General
1.
Building air handling units shall include a preheat coil upstream of chilled water
or hot water reheat coils.  The preheat coil shall be sized to heat building from
initial 40 degrees to 55 degrees within one hour while maintaining minimum
outside airflow requirements (for buildings with automation systems, the
additional capacity to provide for minimum outside air requirements is not
necessary if outside air dampers will be closed during warm-up). 16
2.
Operate face and bypass coils with constant steam or water flow.  Do not
modulate flow.
3.
Provide a sensor in the discharge air stream to maintain a constant discharge air
temperature, regardless of variations in inlet air temperature.


# B.

Design
1.
Design coils for an entering air temperature of minus 10 degrees F for 100
percent outside air systems.  For steam coils, oversize condensate return piping to
handle large condensate flow at startup.17
2.
Provide supply air preheat coils, using hot water or low pressure steam, with the
necessary controls, etc., to protect them from freezing.  The following are


# acceptable systems:

a.
Hot water coil with circulating pump to maintain a minimum coil water
velocity of 4 fps.  Refer to Mechanical Standard Drawing ST-D30GEN-2,
Hot Water Coil – Constant Flow, Fail to Full Heat.
b.
Vertical tube integral face and bypass steam or water coils with clamshell
type dampers to control airflow. 18


# 14  Electric coils have a high operating cost that offsets any low initial cost.  Steam coils are hard to control and require more

maintenance than hot water coils.


# 16  Basis: Preheat enables reasonable time for cold weather startup and restart.  Buildings would not be expected to drop below 40

deg since space heaters or the like would be deployed; similarly, above 55 degrees the reheat coils would continue warm-up.
Lessons learned from MST Office Building.


# 18  Integral face and bypass coils are used as a freeze protection measure.  The temperature of the discharge air is controlled by

proportioning entering air through the multiple heating and bypass channels of the face and bypass coils.  The air is proportioned
by clamshell-shaped dampers, which maintain a constant pressure drop, thus allowing a constant volume of air to pass through
the unit.

# HEATING SYSTEMS

1.0


# A.

LANL projects shall report to the Air Quality Group the planned installation, modification, or
replacement of all fuel-burning equipment for determination of whether the activity or project
requires regulatory permitting, emission monitoring or reporting, etc.  Provide IHS-EAQ with
a description of the equipment or modification; listing size, rating, manufacturer, model
number, fuel, etc.27


# B.

For heating design loads, do not take credit for internal heat gains from equipment that is often
de-energized, especially during off hours, e.g., lights, personal computers.28


# C.

Design low temperature heating hot water systems for a maximum of 180 degrees F supply
temperature.29


# D.

Two-way valves: All heating water systems shall be designed to maximize the number of 2-
way valves (versus 3-way valves) in order to reduce overall pumping power requirements.
Determine minimum flow requirements from pump curve (prevent dead-heading) and provide
with either 2-way minimum flow valves or 3-way valves.  If a minimum flow valve is used, it
shall be placed at the end of the piping run.30


# E.

For 100% outside air systems, use hydronic heating.  Steam, electric resistance, and other
methods are allowed only with ESM Mechanical POC permission.31


# F.

Electric resistance heating systems shall not be used for space heating, except where proven to
be life cycle cost effective.32


# Exceptions:

1.
Where the total capacity of all electric resistance heating systems serving the entire
building is less than 10 percent of the total design output capacity of all heating
systems serving the entire building.
2.
Where the total capacity of all electric resistance heating systems serving the building
is no more than 5 kW.
3.
Where an electric resistance heating system serves an entire building that:
a.
Has a conditioned floor area no greater than 5,000 square feet; and

gas system is impractical, as determined by LANL Utilities and Infrastructure.
4.
Where an electric resistance heating system supplements a heating system in which at
least 60 percent of the annual energy requirements is supplied by site solar or
recovered energy.
5.
Where the electric-resistance heating system supplements a heat pump heating system,
and the heating capacity of the heat pump is more than 75 percent of the calculated
design heating load.


# G.

Guidance: Natural gas is not allowed in some facilities due to safety reasons.  In these
instances natural gas fired boilers located in a separate building should be considered in lieu
of electric heating.


# H.

Guidance: When steam is available from a central plant, consider using a steam-to-hot water
heat exchanger for the heating system.  However, in some instances it may be cost effective to
provide a gas-fired hot water boiler rather than tying into an existing steam and condensate
system.
1.
Provide low pressure steam supply (15 psig maximum) to the heat exchanger and
preheat coil.


# I.

When using TA-3 Powerhouse steam, design for incoming temperature of 500 deg F and150
psig with ability to handle 80 psig.  Civil POC may grant variance to this (pressure is normally
100-115 psig at time of writing but may be increased to about 140 psig in the future).33


# J.

Locate the equipment room at the point of entry of the high pressure steam distribution supply
to the building. Provide a steam PRV within the equipment room per LANL Mechanical
Standard Drawing(s) ST-D3020-2, Steam PRV Station.


# K.

Direct-fired furnaces/heaters are only allowed with ESM Mechanical POC permission.  The
POC can require air quality testing, continuous CO monitoring, or other measures.34


# L.

Mechanical rooms shall have redundant heating to prevent freeze-up in case of a boiler
malfunction (e.g., gas heat, electric heat or multiple boilers).
1.
When gas is available, it is preferred to use gas fired radiant heaters with millivolt gas
controls.  Millivolt gas controls allow the unit to operate when there is an electrical
power outage.


# M.

Entry vestibules: Provide a source of heat to prevent freezing of water on floor and reduce
cold drafts in lobbies during peak use times.


# N.

Locate shell and tube heat exchanges so that the location of joints (unions, flanges, etc) and
adjacent piping, etc. are clear of the tube pulling space.


# O.

Stairwells:  Provide a thermostatically controlled source of heat to prevent freezing of water
on floor or in standpipes. 35

# E.

Provide boiler water treatment.  Refer to Chemical Water Treatment article above.


# F.

Guidance: Condensing boilers: Condensing boilers with peak efficiency greater than 90% and
modulating burners and ducted combustion air should be used.  Flue material should be
stainless or other non-corrosive material and appropriate condensate drain shall be
provided.39 If using a condensing boiler, design all heating coils for 140°F entering water
temperature, to allow boiler to operating at all times in condensing mode.


# 39  Condensing boilers are generally 10% more efficient than non-condensing boilers at low loads and heating water boilers run at low

loads a majority of the time.  Ducting combustion air minimizes the chances of freezing mechanical room piping with un-ducted
combustion air and reduces mechanical room heating costs.

Group all gas vents and pipe one vent to atmosphere above roof to minimize roof
penetrations.
2.
Size vent piping through roof at least one pipe size larger than the largest vent
connection.
3.
Provide vent caps on boiler stacks to keep rain, birds, and debris out of the stack. To
prevent downdrafts and to induce draft (regardless of wind conditions) on

# D.

Guidance: If non-condensing boilers are allowed by the POC and used, hot water boiler
piping may require controls, (e.g., 3-way modulating valve, circulating pump, etc.) to prevent
boiler return water temperature from falling below the combustion chamber condensation
temperature, typically never below 140 degrees F.  Consult with boiler manufacturer for
specific requirements.


# E.

Where required, provide two or more boilers with the determination of the proportion of load
each handles based on energy, redundancy, and maintenance requirements.  Guidance


# examples:

1.
Two boilers: 40 percent and 60 percent or 50 percent and 50 percent of system load.
2.
Three boilers: 40 percent and 60 percent with standby at 60 percent of system load or
50, 50, 50 percent configuration.


# F.

Provide controls that automatically reset hot water for building heating by building loads or by
outside temperature.  Refer to ASHRAE Standard 90.1 (e.g., Section 6.5.4.4), for
requirements.


# G.

Heating water temperature reset: Whenever possible, heating water temperature reset shall be
accomplished by controlling the boiler water supply temperature utilizing the burner controls
rather than controlling a three-way heating water mixing valve.  When using a non-condensing
boiler, the lowest reset temperature shall be 140 degrees F. 45


# H.

Provide an Industrial Risk Insurers (IRI) gas fuel train on gas-fired boilers greater than
400,000 Btu/hr (input rating at sea level) with pressure gauges factory installed on both sides

# COOLING

1.0


# A.

Design cooling systems using mechanical vapor compression equipment (direct expansion
coils or chillers) when close (better than plus or minus 5 degrees F) temperature control in the
space is required.48


# 45  This provides boiler efficiency savings in addition to pipe heat loss energy savings.  The low temperature limit of 140 degrees will

prevent condensation in a non-condensing boiler.


# 48  Based on feedback from field engineers, absorption chillers require more maintenance than mechanical vapor (refrigerant)

compression chillers.  Also, evaporative condensers require freeze protection and close control of water treatment (LANL water is high
in silica) for a successful operation.  Therefore, increased maintenance costs over the life of the equipment must be factored in when
selecting absorption chillers or evaporative condensers.

# HVAC AIR DISTRIBUTION (D3050.50)

4.1
General


# A.

Fabricate, seal, and test duct work to the applicable SMACNA standards.


# B.

Guidance: Consider the following when designing ductwork to control material and energy
costs:63
1.
Use the minimum number of fittings possible.  Fittings may be expensive and the
dynamic pressure loss of fittings is far greater than straight duct sections of equal
centerline length.
2.
Seal ductwork to minimize air leakage.
3.
Use round duct where space and initial cost allows, as round ductwork has the lowest
possible duct friction loss for a given perimeter.
4.
When using rectangular ductwork, maintain the aspect ratio as close to 1 to 1 as
possible to minimize duct friction loss and initial cost.


# C.

Exit passageways, stairs, ramps, and other exits shall not be used as part of a supply, return, or
exhaust air system serving other areas of the building.64  Corridors used to convey air to and
from rooms shall be approved by LANL Fire Protection Group.

mechanical rooms as air plenums.65


# E.

Provide duct systems constructed of metal except for return air sound traps (ST-D3040-2),
flexible connections and flexible air duct connections to equipment and diffusers.66


# F.

Guidance: Round ducts are strongly recommended for industrial exhaust systems because they
provide a more uniform air velocity to resist settling of material and an ability to withstand
higher static pressure.67


# G.

Provide flexible connections immediately adjacent to the suction and discharge ends of
moving equipment, e.g., fans, AHUs, etc.


# H.

Construct exhaust systems with materials suitable for service, e.g., stainless steel, non-
galvanized, etc. Ducts handling high abrasive, corrosive, or radiological materials shall be
smooth (welded longitudinal seam) and free from obstructions, especially at joints.68

Drawing(s) ST-D3040-2.
2.
Coordinate the use of ceiling plenum with the electrical designer for specific
requirements, e.g., plenum-rated cables, etc.


# B.

Guidance: Consider the following when providing a ceiling return air plenum:
1.
Ceiling return air plenums require administration control throughout the life of the
building to maintain the required fire hazard classification within the plenum.
Plenums that do not meet the required classification will require fire protection
sprinklers above the ceiling.
2.
Indoor air quality issues may become a factor due to dust accumulation and rodent
droppings.
3.
With ceiling plenums, future modifications (adding additional piping and cables in the
plenum) may block the air flow.
4.
Ceiling plenums are cheaper to install and usually require less space above the
ceilings.
5.
Balancing is sometimes easier because you are only balancing one duct system, not
two systems.
6.
Open return air plenums are much easier to remodel because of lesser ductwork
above ceiling system.
4.3
Dampers
A. General
1.
Provide opposed blade dampers for modulating (control) applications.71

# A.

Limit the use of duct lining as much as possible (due to potential IAQ issues).  Document
justification for its use.  If its use is justified, limit use to the following:
1.
As an acoustical liner to absorb unwanted crosstalk, equipment, and air rush noise.
2.

confinement ventilation?
An active confinement ventilation system as the preferred design approach for nuclear facilities with potential for radiological
release.3 Alternate confinement approaches may be acceptable if a technical evaluation demonstrates that the alternate
confinement approach results in very high assurance of the confinement of radioactive materials.
The guidance for confinement ventilation systems and evaluation of the alternatives, is provided in DOE Guide (G) 420.1-
1A, Nonreactor Nuclear Safety Design Guide for Use with DOE O 420.1C, Facility Safety.”

# B.

Guidance: Generally, the safety function of ventilation and offgas systems is to provide
confinement integrity and to filter exhaust, thereby preventing or mitigating uncontrolled
releases of radioactive and/or hazardous materials to the environment.  Ventilation and offgas
systems are included as a vital part of the primary and secondary confinement design.


# C.

Provide designs for periodic maintenance, inspection, and testing of components. Include
adequate shielding in the design of filters, absorbers, scrubbers, and other air treatment
components to ensure that occupational exposure limits are not exceeded during maintenance
and inspection activities.  Guidance: Recommended typical equipment layout details are
available from the ESM Mechanical POC.


# D.

Design to facilitate decontamination and demolition, including:
1.
Location of exhaust filtration components of the ventilation systems at or near
individual enclosures to minimize long runs of internally-contaminated ductwork.
Equipment, including effluent decontamination equipment, which precludes to the extent
practicable, the accumulation of radioactive or other hazardous materials in relatively
inaccessible areas, including curves and turns in ductwork.  Accessible, removable
covers for inspection and cleanouts are encouraged.


# E.

Airflow and other design requirements for specific types of ventilation systems shall comply
with 29 CFR 1910, Subparts G and H.  Guidance:  Ventilation systems for hazardous material
protection should use local exhaust ventilation (LEV) to control concentrations of hazardous
materials from discrete sources, or should control the number of air changes per hour for an
entire room or bay (but avoid concentration control by dilution ventilation).  Also, 29 CFR
1910, Subpart Z, provides requirements for monitoring and alarm systems for facilities that
manage or use specific hazardous materials.  Additional guidance on design of ventilation
systems for hazardous material protection is provided in ANSI Z9.2 and ASHRAE 62. 29


# F.

Guidance: Ventilation systems are engineering controls commonly used to prevent worker
exposure to hazardous materials and may be used in combination with personal protective
equipment and operational procedures. 29 CFR 1910, Subpart G, 1910.94, requires that
where ventilation is used to control worker exposures, it is adequate to reduce the hazardous
material concentrations of air contaminants to the degree that the hazardous material no
longer poses a health risk to the worker (i.e., concentrations at or below the permissible
exposure limits). 29 CFR 1910, Subpart Z, 1910.1000, requires that wherever engineering
controls are not sufficient to reduce exposures to such levels, they must be used to reduce
exposures to the lowest practicable level and supplemented by work practice controls.  The
A:   Alternate approaches to an active confinement ventilation system are containment and passive confinement.   A containment
approach differs from a confinement approach in that the goal of containment is 100% containment of radioactive materials. In reality,
even a containment approach results in some level of leakage but this is managed to an absolute minimum by code compliance which
requires periodic penetration leak rate tests and full building leak rate tests (ANS 56.8, Containment System Leakage Testing
Requirements).
Passive confinement involves dependence on minimization of paths of leakage of hazardous materials when a ventilation system is not
running.  The DOE Toolbox Code MELCOR provides a tool for analyzing a building leak path factor (LPF).  Very high assurance of
adequate confinement under passive confinement conditions means a technically defensible analysis of the LPF and comparison of the
results with applicable dose limits under normal and accident conditions.  See MELCOR Computer Code Application Guidance for
Leak Path Factor in Documented Safety Analysis, May 2004.
Leak path Factor (LPF)
For mitigated analysis, analytical tools used in calculating the LPF shall be appropriate to the physical conditions being
modeled, including the use of conservative parameters, such that the overall LPF would be conservative.  [DOE-STD-3009-

design should ensure that respirators are not required for normal operating conditions or
routine maintenance activities except as a precautionary measure30


# G.

Guidance: Ventilation systems for hazardous material protection should use exhaust hoods to
control concentrations of hazardous materials from discrete sources, or should control the
number of air changes per hour for an entire room or bay.  Air flow and other design
requirements for specific types of systems must comply with 29 CFR 1910, Subparts G and H.
Also, 29 CFR 1910, Subpart Z, provides requirements for monitoring and alarm systems for
facilities that manage or use specific hazardous materials.  Additional guidance on design of
ventilation systems for hazardous material protection is provided in ANSI Z9.2 and
ASHRAE 62. Decontamination facilities, safety showers, and eyewashes to mitigate external
exposures to hazardous materials must be provided where mandated by 29 CFR 1910,
Subparts H and Z. These systems must be designed in accordance with the requirements of
ANSI Z358.1 and ANSI Z124.230


# H.

Guidance: Directed ventilation flow paths should be used to move contaminants away from
worker breathing zones.  The design should ensure that ventilation flow will cascade from
clean areas to contaminated areas to preclude contamination spread.  Uniform distribution of
incoming air and/or air mixing equipment should be provided to ensure that no pockets of
stagnant air exist in areas where workers are present30.  If room air is recirculated in a
nuclear or hazardous facility, e.g., Zone 3 maintenance rooms, at least one stage of HEPA
filtration shall be provided in the circulation system, additional stages may be required per
the hazard analysis.


# I.

Guidance: Occupied spaces should be designed to preclude locations where low oxygen
content or air displacement may occur or where reactive, combustible, flammable, or
explosive gas, vapor, or liquid accumulation might occur


# J.

Guidance: The design of airborne-effluent systems should preclude holdup of particulate
materials in offgas and ventilation ductwork and include provisions to continuously monitor
buildup of material and material recovery. The design of systems must also preclude the
accumulation of potentially flammable quantities of gases generated by radiolysis or chemical
reactions within process equipment.31


# K.

Guidance: All airborne effluents from areas in which hazardous or radioactive materials are
managed other than in closed containers should be exhausted through a ventilation system
designed to remove particulate material, vapors, and gases, as necessary, to comply with
applicable release requirements and to reduce releases of radioactive materials to levels
