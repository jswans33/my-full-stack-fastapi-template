rectangle "Document Data" as DocData
rectangle "DocumentClassifier" as Classifier
rectangle "Feature Extraction" as Features
rectangle "ClassifierFactory" as Factory
rectangle "Classifier Selection" as Selection
rectangle "RuleBasedClassifier" as RuleClassifier
rectangle "PatternMatcherClassifier" as PatternClassifier

' Define data flow
DocData --> Classifier
Classifier --> Features : "extract features"
Features --> Factory : "features"
Factory --> Selection : "available classifiers"

Selection --> RuleClassifier : "if rules applicable"
Selection --> PatternClassifier : "if patterns applicable"
Selection --> MLClassifier : "if ML model applicable"

RuleClassifier --> Ensemble : "rule results"
PatternClassifier --> Ensemble : "pattern results"
MLClassifier --> Ensemble : "ML model results"

Ensemble --> Result : "weighted combined result"

' Add notes
note right of Features
  Extracts relevant features
  from document data
end note

note right of Factory
  Creates appropriate classifier
  instances based on config
end note

note right of Ensemble
  Combines results from multiple
  classifiers using weighted voting
end note
