' Define components for the document classifier
rectangle "Document Data" as DocData
rectangle "Document Classifier" as Classifier
rectangle "Feature Detection" as Features
rectangle "Document Schema" as Schema
rectangle "Classification Output" as Output

' Define relationships
DocData --> Features : "extract features"
Features --> Classifier : "analyze features"
Classifier --> Schema : "match against known schemas"
Schema --> Output : "generate classification"

' Add notes
note right of Features
  Extracts metadata, layout, 
  content patterns, and keywords
end note

note right of Classifier
  Applies multiple classification 
  strategies in ensemble
end note

note right of Schema
  Validates document structure
  against known schema types
end note

note right of Output
  Classification with confidence
  scores and extracted data
end note
