' Enhanced notes with cross-references
note bottom of UC2
  PDF processing includes:
  - Text extraction
  - Document classification
  - Data structuring
  - Validation
  
  See diagram 06-02 for sequence
  and 06-03 for detailed components
end note

note right of UC1
  Entry point for manual processing
  Supports various PDF types
end note

note right of UC6
  Templates improve classification accuracy
  Used by classifier components in diagram 06-03
end note

note bottom of UC8
  Allows for automated bulk processing
  See 06-04 for classification decision flow
