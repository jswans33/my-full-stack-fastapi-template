# Pipeline Architecture Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the pipeline architecture documented in the diagrams in this directory.

## System Purpose

The pipeline system is designed to process documents (with a focus on PDF documents) through a series of stages:
- Document ingestion
- Classification
- Schema validation
- Formatting
- Verification
- Output generation

The system follows a modular architecture with multiple components that work together using several design patterns.

## Key Components

### 1. Pipeline Core

The central orchestration component that manages the flow of documents through the system. It delegates to specialized components for specific processing tasks.

**Key Diagrams**:

- [01-02-complete-pipeline-flow.puml](01-02-complete-pipeline-flow.puml): Overall data flow

### 2. Document Classifier

Responsible for determining the type of document being processed. Uses multiple classification strategies that can be combined using an ensemble approach.

- [02-02-document-classifier-flow.puml](02-02-document-classifier-flow.puml): Classification flow
- [02-03-document-classifier-diagram.puml](02-03-document-classifier-diagram.puml): Component diagram

### 3. Formatter

Transforms processed document data into various output formats based on configuration.

**Key Diagrams**:

- [03-02-formatter-flow.puml](03-02-formatter-flow.puml): Data formatting flow

### 4. Verifier

Validates the output to ensure it meets expected quality and structural requirements.

**Key Diagrams**:
- [04-01-verifier-class.puml](04-01-verifier-class.puml): Class diagram
- [04-02-verifier-flow.puml](04-02-verifier-flow.puml): Verification flow

### 5. Schema Registry

Maintains document schemas and validates document structure against registered schemas.

**Key Diagrams**:
- [05-01-schema-registry-class.puml](05-01-schema-registry-class.puml): Class diagram
- [05-02-schema-registry-flow.puml](05-02-schema-registry-flow.puml): Schema validation flow

### 6. PDF Document Processing

Specialized functionality for handling PDF documents, including extraction, classification, and structure analysis.

**Key Diagrams**:
- [06-01-pdf-processing-usecase.puml](06-01-pdf-processing-usecase.puml): Use case diagram
- [06-02-pdf-processing-sequence.puml](06-02-pdf-processing-sequence.puml): Sequence diagram
- [06-03-pdf-classifier-components.puml](06-03-pdf-classifier-components.puml): Component diagram
- [06-04-pdf-classification-decision.puml](06-04-pdf-classification-decision.puml): Decision flow

## Design Patterns Used

The architecture incorporates several design patterns:

1. **Strategy Pattern**: Different interchangeable algorithms for document processing
   - Example: Multiple classifier strategies in the Document Classifier

2. **Factory Pattern**: Creation of concrete implementations without tight coupling
   - Examples: FormatterFactory, VerifierFactory, ClassifierFactory

3. **Dependency Injection**: Components receive their dependencies rather than create them
   - Example: Pipeline component receiving formatters and verifiers

4. **Abstract Interfaces**: Components program to interfaces, not implementations
   - Example: ClassifierStrategy interface with multiple implementations

5. **Ensemble Pattern**: Multiple algorithms combined for better results
   - Example: EnsembleManager in PDF classification (06-03, 06-04)

## Technology Stack

The diagrams illustrate various technologies and approaches used in the system:
- Text extraction and analysis tools for PDF documents
- Machine learning components for classification
- Template matching algorithms
- Schema validation
- Multiple output formatters (JSON, Markdown, etc.)
