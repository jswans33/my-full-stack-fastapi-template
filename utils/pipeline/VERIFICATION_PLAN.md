# Document Processing Pipeline Verification Plan

This document outlines the plan for verifying the enhancements made to the document processing pipeline, specifically focusing on the classification configuration and data extraction improvements.

## Enhancements to Verify

### 1. Enhanced Data Extraction
- [x] Complete content extraction (no truncation of section content)
- [x] Improved table detection with better structure recognition
- [x] Table headers and column information extraction
- [x] Enhanced schema storage with content samples and table data

### 2. Configurable Document Classification
- [x] Central configuration system for document classification
- [x] Rule-based classifier using configuration instead of hardcoded rules
- [x] Filename pattern matching for improved classification
- [ ] Configuration examples for different document types

## Testing Methodology

### Step 1: Run Pipeline with Default Configuration
```bash
python -m utils.pipeline.run_pipeline --file "utils/pipeline/data/input/MF-SPECS_232500 FL - HVAC WATER TREATMENT.pdf" --output utils/pipeline/data/output
```
- Expected result: Document likely classified as "FORM" due to generic rule
- Verification: Check classification result in terminal output
- Success criteria: Terminal output should show classification as "FORM" with confidence around 0.6

### Step 2: Run Pipeline with HVAC Configuration
```bash
python -m utils.pipeline.run_pipeline --file "utils/pipeline/data/input/MF-SPECS_232500 FL - HVAC WATER TREATMENT.pdf" --output utils/pipeline/data/output --config utils/pipeline/config/hvac_config.json
```
- Expected result: Should classify as "HVAC_SPECIFICATION" if configuration is working correctly
- Verification: Check classification result in terminal output
- Success criteria: Terminal output should show classification as "HVAC_SPECIFICATION" with confidence higher than 0.6

### Step 3: List Schemas to Find Schema IDs
```bash
python -m utils.pipeline.visualize_schema list
```
- Expected result: List of schemas including recently processed documents
- Verification: Note schema IDs for both default and HVAC configuration runs
- Success criteria: Two different schema IDs should be listed for the same document processed with different configurations

### Step 4: Verify Table Extraction Enhancements
```bash
python -m utils.pipeline.visualize_schema tables <schema_id>
```
- Expected result: Visualization showing table headers, column counts, and sample data
- Verification: Compare with previous table visualizations to confirm improvements
- Success criteria: 
  * Table headers should be clearly identified
  * Column counts should be accurate
  * Sample data should be displayed for each table
  * No truncation of table content

### Step 5: Verify Content Extraction Enhancements
```bash
python -m utils.pipeline.visualize_schema structure <schema_id>
```
- Expected result: Complete section content without truncation
- Verification: Check for full content in sections
- Success criteria: Section content should be complete without "..." or other truncation indicators

### Step 6: Examine Output JSON Files
```bash
# View the output JSON file
cat utils/pipeline/data/output/MF-SPECS_232500\ FL\ -\ HVAC\ WATER\ TREATMENT.json
```
- Expected result: Complete content, table structures with headers, and proper classification
- Verification: Check for truncation, table structure, and classification information
- Success criteria:
  * JSON should contain complete section content without truncation
  * Table structures should include headers and column information
  * Classification should match the expected document type based on configuration

### Step 7: Verify Filename Pattern Matching
```bash
# Create a test file with a clear HVAC filename pattern
cp "utils/pipeline/data/input/MF-SPECS_232500 FL - HVAC WATER TREATMENT.pdf" "utils/pipeline/data/input/HVAC-SPEC_test.pdf"

# Run pipeline on the renamed file
python -m utils.pipeline.run_pipeline --file "utils/pipeline/data/input/HVAC-SPEC_test.pdf" --output utils/pipeline/data/output
```
- Expected result: Document should be classified as "HVAC_SPECIFICATION" based on filename pattern
- Verification: Check classification result in terminal output
- Success criteria: Terminal output should show classification as "HVAC_SPECIFICATION" with high confidence (>0.8)

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### 1. Classification Override Issue
**Problem**: HVAC documents are being classified as "GENERIC_DOCUMENT" with confidence 0.3 instead of "HVAC_SPECIFICATION" or "FORM"

**Root Causes**: 
- The classification information is not being included in the output JSON file
- The rule-based classifier is not correctly matching HVAC documents
- No tables are being detected in the HVAC document, which prevents the "FORM" classification rule from triggering
- The document path might not be correctly passed to the classifier for filename pattern matching

**Solution Options**:
1. **Fix JSONFormatter to Include Classification**:
   - Modify `utils/pipeline/processors/formatters/json_formatter.py` to include the classification information in the output
   ```python
   formatted_data = {
       "document": {
           "metadata": analyzed_data.get("metadata", {}),
           "path": analyzed_data.get("path", ""),
           "type": analyzed_data.get("type", ""),
       },
       "content": self._build_content_tree(analyzed_data.get("sections", [])),
       "tables": analyzed_data.get("tables", []),
       "summary": analyzed_data.get("summary", {}),
       "validation": analyzed_data.get("validation", {}),
       "classification": analyzed_data.get("classification", {}),  # Add this line
   }
   ```

2. **Improve Table Detection**:
   - Investigate why tables are not being detected in the HVAC document
   - Implement the enhanced table detection algorithm proposed in the ISSUE_FIXES.md document

3. **Modify Rule-Based Classifier to Prioritize Specific Rules**:
   - Change the `classify` method in `rule_based.py` to only use generic classification if confidence is very low (<0.2)
   - This ensures specific document types with reasonable confidence are always preferred over generic types

4. **Ensure Document Path is Correctly Passed**:
   - Verify that the document path is correctly passed to the classifier for filename pattern matching
   - Check if the filename pattern matching logic is working correctly

**Verification Method**:
- After implementing the fixes, run the pipeline with both default and HVAC configurations
- Check if the document is correctly classified as "HVAC_SPECIFICATION" with the HVAC configuration
- Verify that the classification information is included in the output JSON file

### 2. Table Detection Limitations
**Problem**: No tables are being detected in the HVAC document, which is unexpected since HVAC documents typically have tables

**Root Cause**:
- Current implementation uses two approaches (layout analysis and text-based detection)
- Both have limitations with complex tables, merged cells, or tables spanning multiple pages
- The log shows "No tables found on page X" for all pages of the document

**Solution**:
- Enhance the table detection algorithm with a more sophisticated approach as proposed in ISSUE_FIXES.md
- Combine layout analysis with text pattern recognition
- Implement clustering of x-positions to identify column boundaries
- Improve header detection logic
- Add debugging output to understand why tables are not being detected

**Verification Method**:
- After implementing the enhanced table detection algorithm, run the pipeline on the HVAC document
- Check if tables are now being detected
- Use the `visualize_schema tables` command to check table structure
- Verify that headers, columns, and data are correctly identified

### 3. Content Truncation (FIXED)
**Problem**: Previous implementation limited section content to 100 characters

**Root Cause**:
- Code in `pdf_extractor.py` was truncating content with `line[:100]`

**Solution**:
- Remove the truncation limit to capture full content
- Change to `line + "\n"` instead of `line[:100] + "\n"`

**Verification Method**:
- Run the pipeline on a document with long sections
- Use the `visualize_schema structure` command to check section content
- Verify that content is complete without truncation
- The output JSON file shows that content is not being truncated, so this issue appears to be fixed

### 4. Schema Storage Enhancement (âœ… COMPLETED)
**Problem**: Schema storage did not include content samples and table data

**Root Cause**:
- The `record` method in `schema/registry.py` was not storing these details

**Solution**:
- Enhance the `record` method to store:
  * Content samples without truncation
  * Table structure information
  * Sample table data for visualization
  * Detection method information
  * Border information for visualization

**Verification Method**:
- This enhancement has been completed and verified
- The schema now includes all the necessary information for visualization and analysis
- The test_document_20250315153312.json schema shows that content samples and table data are being stored correctly

### 5. Schema Registration Issue
**Problem**: The document is not being registered in the schema registry after processing

**Root Cause**:
- The `record_schemas` configuration option might be set to `False`
- The schema registration logic might not be correctly implemented

**Solution**:
- Check the configuration to ensure `record_schemas` is set to `True`
- Verify that the `_record_schema` method in pipeline.py is being called
- Ensure that the document_type and document_name are correctly passed to the registry

**Verification Method**:
- After implementing the fixes, run the pipeline with both default and HVAC configurations
- Use the `visualize_schema list` command to check if new schemas are registered
- Verify that the schemas contain the correct document_type and document_name
