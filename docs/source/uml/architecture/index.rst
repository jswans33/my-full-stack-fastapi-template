The UML generator is designed with a modular architecture that allows for easy extension and maintenance. 
This section provides an overview of the system's structure, components, and how they interact.

Key architectural features include:

1. **Modular Design**: The system is built with a modular approach that separates concerns and allows for easy extension.
2. **Standardized Outputs**: Consistent output formats and directory structures for generated diagrams.
3. **Extensibility**: The architecture supports adding new diagram types with minimal changes to the core system.
