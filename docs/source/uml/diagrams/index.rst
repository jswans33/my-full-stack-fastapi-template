UML diagrams are categorized into two main types:

Structure Diagrams
-----------------

Structure diagrams show the static structure of the system being modeled:

* **Class Diagrams**: Show the classes in the system, their attributes, operations, and the relationships between them.

Behavior Diagrams
---------------

Behavior diagrams show the dynamic behavior of the objects in a system:

* **Sequence Diagrams**: Show how objects interact with each other and the order of those interactions.
* **Activity Diagrams**: Show the workflow from a start point to a finish point detailing the many decision paths.
* **State Diagrams**: Show the state transitions and events that trigger those transitions.
