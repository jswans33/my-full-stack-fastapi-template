Activity Diagrams
================

Activity diagrams are graphical representations of workflows that show the flow from one activity to another. They are particularly useful for visualizing business processes, workflows, and algorithmic logic.

Overview
-------

Activity diagrams show the workflow from a start point to a finish point, detailing the many decision paths that exist in the progression of events. They are useful for:

* Visualizing the dynamic aspects of a system
* Describing the behavior of a system
* Illustrating business processes and workflows
* Modeling algorithmic logic

Basic Elements
------------

Activity diagrams consist of several key elements:

* **Start Node**: The beginning of the workflow
* **Activities**: The actions or operations being performed
* **Decision Nodes**: Points where the flow branches based on conditions
* **Merge Nodes**: Points where multiple flows converge
* **Fork/Join Nodes**: Points where flow splits into parallel paths or rejoins
* **End Node**: The termination of the workflow

Example Activity Diagram
----------------------

Below is an example of an activity diagram for a user registration process:

.. code-block:: text

    @startuml
    start
    :User enters registration information;
    if (Information is valid?) then (yes)
      :Create user account;
      if (Email verification required?) then (yes)
        :Send verification email;
        :Wait for verification;
        if (Email verified?) then (yes)
          :Activate account;
        else (no)
          :Send reminder email;
          goto Wait for verification;
        endif
      else (no)
        :Activate account;
      endif
      :Redirect to login page;
    else (no)
      :Display validation errors;
      :Return to registration form;
    endif
    stop
    @enduml

Creating Activity Diagrams
------------------------

Activity diagrams can be created using PlantUML syntax. Here's how to create a basic activity diagram:

1. Start with the `@startuml` directive
2. Use `:text;` for activities
3. Use `if (condition) then (yes)` and `else (no)` for decision points
4. Use `fork` and `join` for parallel activities
5. End with the `@enduml` directive

Example PlantUML Code
-------------------

.. code-block:: text

    @startuml
    start
    :Initialize System;
    fork
      :Process A;
      if (Condition A) then (yes)
        :Action A1;
      else (no)
        :Action A2;
      endif
    fork again
      :Process B;
      if (Condition B) then (yes)
        :Action B1;
      else (no)
        :Action B2;
      endif
    end fork
    :Finalize System;
    stop
    @enduml

Integration with the UML Generator
--------------------------------

The UML generator can be extended to support activity diagrams. This would involve:

1. Creating model classes for activity diagram elements
2. Implementing a generator for converting these models to PlantUML
3. Adding support for parsing activity diagram definitions from YAML or other formats

Future Work
----------

Future enhancements for activity diagram support could include:

* Automatic extraction of activity flows from code comments
* Integration with workflow engines or business process management systems
* Interactive editing of activity diagrams
* Validation of activity diagrams against business rules
