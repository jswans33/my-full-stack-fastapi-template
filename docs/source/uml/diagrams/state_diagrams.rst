State Diagrams
=============

State diagrams, also known as state machine diagrams, show the different states of an entity and how it transitions between those states in response to events. They are particularly useful for modeling the behavior of objects that change states during their lifecycle.

Overview
-------

State diagrams are used to:

* Model the lifecycle of an object
* Visualize how an entity responds to different events
* Document the possible states of a system
* Illustrate the conditions that trigger state transitions

Basic Elements
------------

State diagrams consist of several key elements:

* **States**: Conditions or situations during the life of an object
* **Transitions**: Paths from one state to another
* **Events**: Triggers that cause a transition
* **Guards**: Conditions that must be true for a transition to occur
* **Actions**: Activities that occur during a state transition
* **Initial State**: The starting point of the state machine
* **Final State**: The end point of the state machine (if applicable)

Example State Diagram
-------------------

Below is an example of a state diagram for a document approval process:

.. code-block:: text

    @startuml
    [*] --> Draft
    
    Draft --> UnderReview : Submit
    UnderReview --> Draft : Request Changes
    UnderReview --> Approved : Approve
    UnderReview --> Rejected : Reject
    
    Approved --> Published : Publish
    
    Rejected --> Draft : Revise
    
    Published --> [*]
    @enduml

Creating State Diagrams
---------------------

State diagrams can be created using PlantUML syntax. Here's how to create a basic state diagram:

1. Start with the `@startuml` directive
2. Use `[*]` for initial and final states
3. Use `-->` for transitions
4. Add event labels after a colon
5. End with the `@enduml` directive

Example PlantUML Code
-------------------

.. code-block:: text

    @startuml
    scale 350 width
    
    [*] --> NotShooting
    
    NotShooting --> Shooting : trigger pressed
    Shooting --> NotShooting : trigger released
    
    state NotShooting {
      [*] --> Idle
      Idle --> Configuring : configure
      Configuring --> Idle : cancel
      Configuring --> Ready : confirm
    }
    
    state Shooting {
      [*] --> Aiming
      Aiming --> Firing : aim completed
      Firing --> Reloading : ammo depleted
      Reloading --> Aiming : reload completed
    }
    
    @enduml

Composite States
--------------

State diagrams can include composite states (states that contain other states):

.. code-block:: text

    @startuml
    [*] --> Active
    
    state Active {
      [*] --> Idle
      Idle --> Processing : request
      Processing --> Idle : complete
      Processing --> Error : error
      Error --> Idle : resolve
    }
    
    Active --> Inactive : shutdown
    Inactive --> Active : startup
    
    @enduml

Integration with the UML Generator
--------------------------------

The UML generator can be extended to support state diagrams. This would involve:

1. Creating model classes for state diagram elements
2. Implementing a generator for converting these models to PlantUML
3. Adding support for parsing state diagram definitions from YAML or other formats

Future Work
----------

Future enhancements for state diagram support could include:

* Automatic extraction of state machines from code
* Integration with state machine frameworks
* Interactive editing of state diagrams
* Validation of state diagrams against implementation
* Code generation from state diagrams
